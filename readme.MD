## üî¢ Integer Exercises

### Exercise 1: Even/Odd Checker
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer and determines whether the number is even or odd. Display an appropriate message for each case.

**Sample Input/Output:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd

Enter a number: 12
12 is even
```

**Skills Practiced:** Basic I/O, conditionals, modulo operator

---

### Exercise 2: Sum of Digits
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Create a program that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 10 (1+2+3+4).
